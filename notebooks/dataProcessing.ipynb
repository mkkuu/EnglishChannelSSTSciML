    "We manually downloaded NetCDF database on both official website of NOAA and Copernicus Marine. Concerning NOAA, we had to download the whole world database year by year, hence, we will need to merge those 10 files and only keep the data that interests us (Manche area, latitude between 51 and 48, longitude between 5 and -2). Concerning Copernicus Marine, website permits us to download only the data we need by applying spatial and time constraint, we will only need to merge 2 NetCDF files (since download from website is size restricted, we had to download it in 2 times, 2010-2015 and 2015-2020)."
